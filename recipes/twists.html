    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My grandmother used to make these every year for Christmas, though she is
      gone I have happily carried on that tradition.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 tsp granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2-1/4 tsp (1 pkg) active dry yeast (not quick rise)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Zest of 1 large orange</li>
      <li>3-3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shortening, cubed</li>
      <li>12 cup <strong>unsalted</strong> butter, cubed</li>
      <li>1 cup sugar, divided into portions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <h3>Make Dough</h3>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar and yeast with warm water (~110
        degrees). Set aside for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together sour cream, sugar, eggs, vanilla and
        orange zest. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl (or food processer) mix flour and salt. Cut butter and
        Shortening into flour mixture until it looks slightly coarse.
      </li>
      <li>Add yeast mixture and combine thoroughly.</li>
      <li>
        Add sour cream mixture and combine thoroughly until dough pulls away
        from sides to form a ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place dough into a large bowl, cover and chill for minimum 8 hours.
        Overnight is best.
      </li>
      <h3>Assembly</h3>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350F. Position rack in center of oven. Prepare 2 large
        baking sheets, lined with parchment paper. Remove dough from
        refrigerator and divide in half, return half to refrigerator.
      </li>
      <li>Generously sprinkle approx. 1/4 cup sugar onto clean surface.</li>
      <li>
        Press dough into a rectangle. Roll out and flip over to roll again.
        Sprinkle sugar as you go to prevent sticking. Once the dough measures an
        8x16 inch rectangle, sprinkle 1/4 cup sugar over the dough's surface.
        Fold one end to the center and the other end over the first. Roll out
        again to a 8x16 inch rectangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the longest width, divide dough evenly into 16 sections. Gently grab
        each strip in the center and narrowly twist out to opposite ends. If
        desired, pinch ends together into circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 18 minutes, or until the edges just start to turn light brown
        and caramelized.
      </li>
      <li>repeat for remaining half of dough.</li>
    </ol>
